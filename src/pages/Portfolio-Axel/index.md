  In order to discover the graphic design software Figma, I suggested to a classmate to think about his portfolio. Here are the models I made when I first used Figma.

  Axel Dos Santos is a person with whom I have studied for the last two years at the IUT in Dijon, it is in his company that I have worked a lot on photography and image. He is currently in film school in Paris.

I started working on the development of his site using the same technologies as my own portfolio, i.e. GatsbyJS and React. In case Axel would like to become independent, I will work more seriously on his portfolio, especially in terms of UX Design.
