I designed this site mainly to test tools and build skills. <br/>
For the design I used mainly the Figma software. <br/>
And for the development  of the site I used Nuxt and VueJS . <br/>
This is the first project I have done with VueJs 

You can try the site here : <a href="https://ingenium-portfolio.netlify.com" target="_blanck"><b>INGENIVM PORTFOLIO</b></a>

Be careful this site is not perfect, I plan to work on it again in the future. 
If you want, you can tell me your opinion !
